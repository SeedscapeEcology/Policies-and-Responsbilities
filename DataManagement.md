To promote collaboration across institutes and the sharing of data, models, and other products, the cyberinfrastructure utilized by the research team will support all stages of the data lifecycle, from creation, processing, documenting, preserving, and sharing to reusing data.

## Types of data

Our research group generates a variety of data, including raw LC-MS-MS data and associated metadata from metabolomics analyses, observational data, experimental data, source code for data synthesis and models, derived data, and results from analyses and modeling efforts.  Other materials produced include research results  published in peer-reviewed journals, educational materials, video lectures,  and tutorials. 

## Data and Metadata Standards

For ecological data, we will use existing and emerging standards for documenting and preserving data and follow best practices suggested by the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE; Strasser et al. 2012). We will include metadata following the standardized Ecological Metadata Language. Metadata can be generated through Morpho, a free online data management tool developed by the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp). 

For documenting derived data, best practices by DataONE suggest including a description of the primary data, derived data, data processing details, and any problems that emerged and how they were dealt with.

To describe simulation models, such as individual-based models, we will use the proposed standard protocol developed by Grimm et al. (2006, 2010). 

For metabolomics data, we will use standards established and peer-reviewed by metabolomics researchers for documenting and preserving chemical data and data analyses (Sumner et al. 2007). These include documentation of sample preparation and processing conditions, as well as parameters for all steps in the chemical analysis pipeline, from mass spectrometry experimental design to data interpretation. Metadata in contributed datasets will follow the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (Goodacre et al. 2007). 

## Roles and Responsibilities 

The PI, postdoctoral scholar, and graduate students will develop protocols for data collection, data processing (e.g., quality assurance and control) and documenting (e.g., annotation with metadata). All members of the research group will be responsible for following these protocols for data processing and documentation. The lead author for each study (PI, the postdoctoral scholar, or the graduate student) will ensure data have appropriate documentation and metadata and deposit data in appropriate repositories at the time of publication.The project lead in collaboration with the PI will ensure any unpublished data are made publicly available at the close of the project.

## Dissemination Methods

The Seedscape Ecology website summarizes relevant products and information on how to access these products, including links to the repository, source code, peer-reviewed publications, as well as products for communicating our scientific results to the public. We will use existing repository services to facilitate collaboration through sharing of files, data, source code, derived data, and results to stimulate the generation and development of ideas, theory, meta-analyses, and models. We use Box for file storage with weekly backups and version control of non-code documents. We  use GitHub, a software repository with version control, to facilitate collaboration and review of code for analysis. Raw chromatography and mass spectrometry data will be made publicly available through MetaboLights (Haug et al. 2012) and annotated metabolomics data through GNPS MassIVE (Wang et al. 2016). Source code will be made publicly available through GitHub. 

## Policies for Data Sharing and Public Access

As publicly funded research, any data products created by the research team (meta-analyses, source code, datasets) must be made available to other scientists and the public. Final products will be made publicly available and published (using Digital Object Identifiers or DOI) in repositories with appropriate attribution and citation information. 


## Archiving, Storage and Preservation

For data publication and permanent archival, we will plan to use the GNPS MassIVE repository as well as MetaboLights for the mass spectrometry data and the Environmental Data Initiative or Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity for ecological data. All of these repositories accept multiple data formats, assign permanent unique identifiers (MassIVE ID, MetaboLights ID, or DOI), and ensure data are discoverable, reusable, and citable. In addition, MassIVE automatically ensures that molecular library matches remain up-to-date by periodically comparing datasets to the ever-growing libraries linked to GNPS. Source code created through the project will be assigned a DOI and made freely and publicly available using GitHub. R packages and tutorials will be submitted to rOpenSci for peer review. All other products will be archived at USUâ€™s official institutional repository (DigitalCommons@USU).
