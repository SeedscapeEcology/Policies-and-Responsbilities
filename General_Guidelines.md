# General Guidelines
Welcome to the [Beckman Research Group](www.noellebeckman.com)! Research questions in the group are interdisciplinary, drawing on ecology, behavior, and evolution, and involve mathematical, statistical, and empirical approaches. Our aim is to produce actionable science that contributes solutions to socio-environmental problems, disseminate our results to the broader community, and promote a diverse and inclusive community that welcomes and respects diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

This is a living document created by and for the research group to support an inclusive community in which everyone can thrive. As such, each member of the group actively contributes to the revision of these policies to ensure that they reflect the values and expectations of the current group. Revisions will be discussed and agreed upon as a group annually and when new members join.

## Mentoring philosophy  

As my research group is interdisciplinary and values communicating research to diverse audiences, it provides mentees a variety of opportunities to engage in research and science communication that best aligns with their academic and career goals. In my research group, I encourage an interdisciplinary approach and provide a stimulating and challenging scientific environment in which members can exchange ideas, pursue independent research, and establish collaborations across disciplines. As a mentor, I offer guidance and support along each mentee's career path to help them achieve their individual goals. I strive to maintain an open and inclusive environment that promotes collaborative learning and research and in which each individual can bring their whole self. 

I utilize a group mentoring approach, which provides mentees with not just one, but several mentors. Each person brings unique experiences, perspectives, and skills to the group from which we can all learn from. I emphasize collaboraton and shared decision-making, so that leadership is shared amongst the group. Through this group mentoring approach, mentees develop expertise and skillsets relevant for a wide range of careers as well as gain diverse perspectives on career paths and options.

I am continually learning and evolving strategies to successfully mentor and foster a diverse community. If you have suggestions for promoting community and inclusivity, then please let me (Noelle) know how we can remove barriers to ensure everyone has a rewarding, stimulating, and supportive educational experience. 


## Group Expectations

* I trust everyone in the group to be hardworking, respectful, conscientious, kind, and open to learning. Please see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Policies-and-Responsbilities/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md). 

* Everyone is at a different stage of learning and and has their own unique perspectives and assumptions. The knowledge of the world is vast, and no one is expected to know everything, but everyone is expected to be curious and ask questions for clarification or further discussion.

* I expect everyone to be active members of the department. Each individual is expected to attend departmental and Ecology Center seminars, sign up to meet with speakers, and encouraged to participate in social events.

* I expect everyone to attend weekly team meetings and present updates on their research at least once a year. Research presentations are a great way to enhance presentation skills and gain feedback on your work. I also meet with the [Math Bio group](https://biomath.usu.edu/people/faculty/index) during the academic year and invite anyone interested to attend.

* I expect everyone to keep the lap space clean. Always wash and put away dishes, keep the main table and countertops clean and free of things at the end of each day.  If you are working on a project throughout the day you may leave equipment out, but this must all be put away at the end of the day in order to keep our shared space clean. 


* I expect everyone in the group to continuously educate yourself and actively engage in community excellence. Participate in events offered by USU ([Center for Community](https://www.usu.edu/community/engage/)) or at conferences you are attending (e.g., opportunities @ [ESA](https://esa.org/about/diversity-in-ecology/), [SACNAS](http://sacnas.org)). 



## Mentee Expectations

* While I am closely involved in the research of undergraduate and master's students, I expect a high level of independence from doctoral students and postdoctoral scholars. I expect mentees to develop projects in collaboration with me that broadly overlap with my research. 

* Initially, we will meet one-on-one every week for approximately an hour to discuss goals, directions and progress; the regularity, length, and objective of these meetings will shift as you progress in your career but I encourage regular meetings throughout your tenure in the group (e.g., once a week or every other week). 

* During your time in the group, we will explore opportunities to expand and strengthen your skillset and advance your short- and long-term goals. Within the first month, you will fill out an [Individual Development Form](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Onboarding/blob/master/Setting-up-your-IDP.md) and meet with Noelle to discuss shared expectations and goals. We will revisit this on a regular basis to ensure you are making progress, and, if necessary, adjust the plan. 

* I expect you to manage your own time and projects and will share time management strategies that I've learned.

* I expect you to get professional and academic advice from me as well as others, because diverse feedback makes for better decisions. You should seriously consider any advice, but ultimately you will make your own informed decision.

* I expect everyone to [write, write, write](http://www.simonqueenborough.info/assets/pubs/bes-bulletin/2012-BESbulletin-writing.pdf)! We will do this both formally and informally through weekly reflections, [blog posts](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Onboarding/SeedscapeBlog.md), idea summaries, grant applications, and manuscripts. I recommend reading [How to Write A Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writing](https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4441031). *Please send me drafts of fellowship and grant applications and inform me of letters of recommedation at least two weeks before the deadline.* This will allow ample time for several rounds of critical review and revision. 


* I expect all postdoctoral scholars and grad students, regardless of intended career path, to be working towards writing up the results of their research as peer-reviewed publications. PhD students should aim to have 3-5 first-author publications (with at least 1-2 co-authored with me), and MS students should have 1-2 first-author publications (co-authored with me) during their time here. Postdoctoral scholars should aim to have at least 1 first-author publication per year (co-authored with me). I expect PhD students to have at least one publication submitted before they defend their dissertation, and MS students will be well on their way to submitting (or have submitted) 1 paper before they defend their thesis. I anticipate that all team members may also be working on publishing manuscripts from prior positions, and similarly I expect that team members will work to finalize their publications with me, even after they leave the research group.

* I encourage each graduate student and postdoctoral scholar to set up their own website that is an online version of their CV. The website should showcase your research and teaching interests and achievements. There are many options to create websites, including [Github](https://pages.github.com), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com), or [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com). Read over [Dr. Alex Bond's advice on why one should have a personal academic website and how to build it](https://labandfield.wordpress.com/2013/06/19/personal-academic-websites-for-faculty-grad-students-the-why-what-and-how/). 

* Please take advantage of the training opportunities for professional development and skill development offered by the [Office of Research and Graduate Studies](https://gradschool.usu.edu/trainings/), [Climate Adaptation Science Program](https://climateadaptation.usu.edu), the [Ecology Center](http://ecology.usu.edu), and the [Career Design Center](https://www.usu.edu/career-design-center/).

* Finally, take care of yourself and support others. Graduate school is a time of personal and professional growth and comes with many opportunities and challenges.  [Follow this link](https://gradschool.usu.edu/resources/student-resources) for resources to help you support yourself and others. If there are issues you do not feel comfortable discussing with Noelle, please contact the [Department Head](http://biology.usu.edu/about/administration/index). 

* See [Onboarding materials here](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Onboarding) and begin with [your first day](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Onboarding/FirstDay.md).

### Funding/Time Commitment to Research

* Graduate students: Depending on available funding or other circumstances, you may be supported through a teaching assistantship (TA), research assistantship (RA), or a fellowship. A full-time assistantship implies 20 hours per week of assigned duties on average. If working as a TA, it is expected that you fulfill your teaching responsibilities as required by the instructor. It is also expected that you continue to make research progress as a TA. However, it is understood that TA responsibilities will take away from research time. If working as a RA, it is expected that you fullfill your research responsibilities for the relevant project as deliverables need to be completed for that funding agency.

 
* Postdoctoral scholars: It is important to me that you continue to progress in your career. I expect you to continue to complete products from your past research projects, however the majority of your time (approximately 80%) should be dedicated to the current position. I trust that you will decide how to manage your time and productivity to be most efficient in completing your projects.

* Securing your own fellowship provides you the most flexibility in terms of research time and topic, I expect early career scholars to write and submit fellowship applications whenever possible. 


## Mentor Expectations

* I agree to provide guidance, support, and advice to support your academic pursuits and career development. I will assist in setting and achieving specific goals related to your graduate program and to your long-term professional aspirations.

* When you provide me with a draft proposal or manuscript, I will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. My commitment is to provide you with a meaningful response within 1-2 weeks.

* You can expect my best efforts to provide research equipment, supplies, resources, etc. to support your research. I will not always have funds to support individual experiments, but I will work with you to apply for funding. 

* To help you build a strong scientific network, I will connect you with colleagues who might become potential collaborators or mentors that can offer additional perspectives.  I will offer opportunities for you to engage with others through workshops, seminars, conferences, and other relevant events. If areas of your research project fall outside of my expertise, I will work with you to find a mentor that can collaborate and advise on these aspects of your research. I will also work with you to expand your network to ensure you get guidance for the career paths that interest you most. I strongly encourage you to regularly discuss your future career goals with me, as it will allow me to better customize networking opportunities to align with your specific needs. Together, we will work towards expanding your network and enhancing your professional development.


* I will support you in your career by writing letters of recommendation. At least two weeks before the deadline, please provide me with the following information: (i) due date for the letter, (ii) details of what the letter is for, (iii) instructions for what should be included in the letter, (iv) where to submit/send the letter, and (v) a draft copy of your application materials so I can tailor the letter. Some letters have the same deadline as the application, even if the application only asks you to provide name and contact information of letter writers. If you cannot find an explicit due date for the recommendation letter, either ask for clarification or assume they are due the same day your application is due and plan accordingly.

* For graduate students for which I serve as the major advisor, I will serve in accordance to the expectations as outlined in the respective department’s policy/handbook (e.g., clarifying expectations for milestones in consensus with the committee).

## Communication
We use **Slack** to communicate within the research group. This helps keep communications organized and in one place. Please respond promptly to messages on Slack or email. If no one in the group has heard from you within 48 hours, we will worry and check-in on you.

We use a **shared google calendar** to share the time and locations of seminars and meetings (e.g. team meetings) relevant for the research group. If you will be out of town for work or vacation, please note this in the calendar. 

Please use the [Google sign-out form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSV1s0GPbhkOe3O3JvM_f45rS28FM8Ixg-nKIeEB1iXqFC0Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) to sign-out items (e.g., books, equipment, etc). When you check-in your item, please edit the same form that you used to check out the item.

If you are working in the field/lab, our inventory of field and lab supplies is on Box. Please send Noelle a request for additional items for the group.

## Team Roles

Leadership is shared amongst the group, with students rotating through different roles each semester. These roles—created collaboratively as a group—allow students to take ownership of our community. [For a list of current roles and responsibilities, see here.](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Policies-and-Responsbilities/blob/master/Seedscape-Team-Roles.md)

## Data management and ownership

Data are the property of the research group and should be accessible to all members of the research group. All data and source code should be accessible in a shared folder via Box or Github. Please provide enough clarity that any member of the lab could reproduce the project and utilize the data in subsequent analyses. Once a project is completed, I expect you to publish your data, results, and other relevant products in appropriate venues accessible to other scientists and the public.

Please see our [Data Management Plan](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Policies-and-Responsbilities/DataManagement.md) and read over the [source code, data, and reproducibility guidelines](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Onboarding/blob/master/Reproducibility.md) for more information. 


## Safety & Safety Training
Read over USU's and the Department of Biology's [safety policies](http://www.biology.usu.edu/safety/biology_dept_safety_resources) and take the required training for research labs and field work if this is required for your research. Please fill out the Biology Department Safety Declaration under the "Safety Training" tab. If you are working in Panama, read over the [Pre-trip Advice](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/Onboarding/blob/master/PreTripAdvice_Panama.md). Please read over relevant safety plans and resources in the [Safety folder](https://usu.box.com/s/z6c5zy3u53w4jayvh18le4gcmtos5vwi) within the Group-Resources Folder. If you are working the lab or field, please read and sign the relevant Team Member Responsibility and Disclaimer forms as well as the relevant Standard Operating Procedures.


## Time Off: Vacation & USU Holidays 

It is important to maintain a healthy work-life balance and I encourage you to take vacation time each year. It would be appropriate to take up to 3 weeks/year. I generally expect at least one month's notice before taking a planned vacation. I also expect consideration of upcoming grants, conferences, and other deadlines when planning vacation. 

There is a difference between academic holidays and official university holidays. Academic holidays (fall break, spring break, etc.) are breaks from classes, but are not considered official university holidays. If you wish to take a vacation during academic holidays, please treat it as vacation time and talk to me in advance. Official university holidays are days when the university will be closed. You are generally not expected to work on those days, and we will not hold meetings on university holidays.


## Strategy for Resolving Disputes
Both of us will make a good faith effort to resolve any disputes that may arise. If needed, either one of us may request advice or assistance from other parties. These include but are not limited to other members of the student’s graduate committee, the department head, or, in extreme cases, the College of Science dean, associate dean for graduate studies, or vice-provost of graduate studies may be consulted. 
## Graduate Student Policies and Deadlines

For more information on institutional policies, expectations, and resources, read over the graduate student [policies and handbook of the Department of Biology](https://biology.usu.edu/education/graduate-program/prospective_students), [requirements for the Ecology Center](http://ecology.usu.edu/for_students/index), and the [resources for Current Students from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies](https://rgs.usu.edu/graduateschool/current-students/). The [Graduate Program Officer](https://rgs.usu.edu/graduateschool/graduate-program-coordinators/#find-your-gpc) for your department can help with questions or concerns regarding graduate school policies and deadlines.

## Flexible Working Hours
This sentence is from [Bastian Greshake's](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke) email footer and forms the basis of the Beckman Research Group's policy on flexible working:

> While I may be sending this email outside my normal office hours, I have no expectation to receive a reply outside yours.

The hours that group members choose to work is up to them. We are each welcome to send work-related emails or pull requests over the weekend or late at night, but no group member is required to reply to them outside of their typical work hours (9am to 5pm).

Research group members are welcome to work flexibly for any reason. Ideally, all group members will schedule at least a few hours each week to overlap with Noelle's presence, to stay in touch with any challenges or successes, but it is the policy of the Beckman Research Group that every member is already self-motivated and doesn't need to work a traditional 9 to 5 day in order to meet their goals.

**If you experience any challenges related to flexible working within the group** then please contact [Noelle Beckman](https://github.com/seedscape). All communication will be treated as confidential.
