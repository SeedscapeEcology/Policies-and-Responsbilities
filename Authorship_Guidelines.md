# Authorship Guidelines

We adhere to the [ESA Code of Ethics on authorship](https://www.esa.org/esa/about/governance/esa-code-of-ethics/). Here we provide additional guidelines on authorship for the Beckman Research Group and collaborators. *This is a dynamic document; please suggest modifications to improve these general guidelines*. 

Discussions on authorship is an interative process, and we encourage that they happen before initiation of a research project and continue throughout all stages of the project. These guidelines are to provide a basis for an open and continuing discussion on authorship among collaborators. They are inspired by [Oliver *et al.* (2018)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ecs2.2206), other sources listed below, and past collaborative experiences. 

The aim is to ensure every team member that contributes sufficiently to a manuscript receives co-authorship. What constitutes as substantial contribution for co-authorship should be discussed before the initiation of the research project. Team members shoud discuss author responsibilities and criteria to assign author order. [Oliver *et al.* (2018)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ecs2.2206) provide a nice example of guidelines that clearly define author responsibilities and the types of contributions that constitute co-authorship (see [Appendix 1](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Fecs2.2206&file=ecs22206-sup-0001-AppendixS1.pdf)). Also, see the [taxonomy of author contributions developed by CRediT](http://credit.niso.org/contributor-roles-defined/).

###### Below are some examples of the types of contributions that may constitute authorship:

- conceive the ideas or experimental design
- unpublished data, model, or code
- compiled or synthesized data
- analysis of data, model, or code
- interpretation of results
- development of figures or tables
- generate new text


## Author responsibilities
- **Lead author(s)** performed most of the work on the project and wrote the majority of the manuscript. They are responsible for communicating regularly with co-authors on the progress of the research. They are expected to facilitate discussions on authorship guidelines before, during, and after the project. 
- **Corresponding author** is responsible for managing the submission, including sharing the final manuscript and cover letter with all co-authors before submission, submitting the manuscript, forwarding manuscript decisions and reviews to all co-authors, and responding to reviewer comments.

- **All Authors**
  - **Critical review of manuscript.** All authors must critically review and revise the manuscript at least once. Conducting grammatical edits and including comments of suggested revisions does not count. 
  - **Approval of final version.** All authors must approve the final version of the mansucript before submission and agree to read the final version within a reasonable timeline (< 1-2 weeks) to avoid publication delays.

- **Statement on author contributions.** Each manuscript must include a statement on author contributions. If the journal does not publish such a statement, the statement will be made available as an online supplement or appendix. The lead author(s) will send a draft of the statement to all co-authors for approval and any corrections.
- **Authorship order.** Lead author(s) will be listed first, and the senior author/ PI will be listed last. Generally, co-authors will be listed in order of contribution, but if co-authors contribute relatively equally, they may be listed alphabetically. In manuscripts with a large number of authors, groups of co-authors may be listed in tiers. Details on how authorship order was determined should be included in the statement of author contributions.
- **Conflict resolution.** If prospective co-authors do not contribute as agreed upon, they are recommended to step down from the manuscript. If a prospective author has not contributed as agreed upon and has not decided to step down, a group of team members will evaluate the issue. If an author is unresponsive after a reasonable amount of time (e.g 2-3 weeks) and continued follow-up, they will be omitted as an author.
